## Batch 4 of exercises

1. Create an empty GitHub repository. Set it as private and don't add any file
   to it (from GitHub).

2. Add the new remote to your tictactoe repository. Push the main branch to
   github. See the result.

3. Modify the README.md file directly from github and commit the result. Follow
   up pulling those changes with `git pull`.

4. Clone **this** repository! (url:
   _https://github.com/rodolfocarobene/git_lecture.git_)

5. Create a new branch with your name in this repository (git_lecture) with some
   small changes and push it. Do not use the **main** branch! Look from github
   the branches your collegues are creating and pushing! Pull them all and look
   at the differences between them.
